1- Create a MYSql database "no tables", named db_cinema_montreal.

2- I used an EsayPHP account: Username: admin Password: empty.

3- Location of images used in this application:
for the application to read the images without error,
we must put the images in this following path:

c: \ Users \ the-active-session \ cinema \ images
in my case my active session is admin.
